Project: Build a Spring Boot API for a Task Management System
Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

    Create a Spring Boot API to manage a task list.
    Use annotations like @RestController, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, and @PutMapping to handle HTTP requests.
    Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Spring Data JPA.
    Integrate the application with a simple database (H2 or MySQL).
    Handle user input validation and return structured JSON responses.

Project Description

You are tasked with developing a Spring Boot API for a Task Management System. The API will:

    Allow users to manage a list of tasks.
    Include operations to create, view, update, and delete tasks.
    Use a database (H2 or MySQL) to persist task data.
    Expose endpoints for managing tasks, with functionality for marking tasks as completed.
    Return proper HTTP status codes and structured responses.

Instructions
Step 1: Setup the Project

    Use Spring Initializer 

    Links to an external site. to generate a new Spring Boot project.
        Add the following dependencies:
            Spring Web (to create RESTful APIs).
            Spring Data JPA (to interact with the database).
            H2 Database (or MySQL for persistent storage).
    Import the generated project into your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.).

Step 2: Create the Task Entity

    Define a Task class to represent the structure of the data youâ€™ll manage.
    Include fields such as:
        id (unique identifier)
        title (name of the task)
        description (details of the task)
        status (to indicate if the task is completed)
        createdDate (timestamp for when the task was created)
    Configure the class as a database entity to enable persistence.

Step 3: Create the Task Repository

    Create a repository interface to handle database interactions for the Task entity.
    Use the repository to perform operations like saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting task records.

Step 4: Create the Task Controller

    Build a REST controller to expose the endpoints for managing tasks.
    Define the following endpoints:
        Get All Tasks: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
        Get Task by ID: Retrieve details of a specific task.
        Add a New Task: Create a new task.
        Update a Task: Update the details or status of a task.
        Delete a Task: Remove a task from the system.

Step 5: Configure the Application

    Use the application.properties file to configure the database:
        For H2: Enable the H2 console for easy database visualization.
        For MySQL: Add the database URL, username, and password.
    Configure other properties such as the server port (if needed).

Step 6: Add Validation and Error Handling

    Use annotations like @Valid and @NotNull to validate user input (e.g., title should not be empty).
    Implement exception handling to return meaningful error messages for invalid requests or missing resources.

Step 7: Run and Test the Application

    Start the Spring Boot application using the main() method in the Application class.
    Use tools like Postman, cURL, or your web browser to test the endpoints.
        Test creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks.
        Verify that the application correctly validates input and handles errors gracefully.
